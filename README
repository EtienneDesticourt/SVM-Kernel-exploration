Application of the support vector machine algorithm to identify block ciphers.
Very interesting project but didn't have time to finish it.

Possible ameliorations: Fix the sigmoid kernel, add soft margin.

Skills acquired: SVMs, SVM kernels
Skills consolidated: numpy, matrix operations, going from scalar operations to matricial operations, plotting (matplotlib)
